 Leetspeak is an internet phenomenon that predates the World Wide Web.
 
 Itâ€™s a style of typing that replaces English letters with similar-looking numbers or symbols, and its closely tied to early hacking and gaming culture.

                                                                  History
                                                                  
Leetspeak arose to prevent the automatic read out of mails and messages by algorithms.

Machines can not detect the word S3cr3t as Secret, but humans can (linguistic redundancy). Because of this modifications, leetspeak has a sort of protection against spamfilter working with a blacklist. 

Passwords using leetspeak are much safer than protecting from bruteforce-attacks with word-lists.

                                                               Application
                                                               
Leetspeak was also used to identify other elite computer nerds, and it was used in the registration process for some elite groups (to weed out anyone who wasn't a hax0r).

The use of leetspeak as a cipher continued into the 90s, where it was used as a calling card by the Cult of the Dead Cow.
